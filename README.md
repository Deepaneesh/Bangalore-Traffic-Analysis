### Abstract

**"Analyzing the Impact of Climate Change on Bangalore Traffic: A Predictive Study Using ARIMA Modeling"**

Bangalore, known for its rapid urbanization and expanding population, faces significant challenges with traffic congestion. This project aims to analyze traffic patterns in Bangalore with a focus on how weekdays and climatic changes influence average traffic speed and congestion levels. By leveraging historical traffic data and weather conditions, the study examines the interplay between climate variables (such as rainfall, temperature, and humidity) and traffic flow dynamics.

The project seeks to:  
1. Evaluate the impact of climate changes on average traffic speed and congestion during weekdays.  
2. Identify critical weather conditions that exacerbate traffic delays.  
3. Predict future average traffic patterns over a month using ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling.  

The analysis integrates statistical and machine learning techniques to understand variability in traffic across different weather scenarios and weekdays. ARIMA modeling will be employed to forecast traffic trends, providing actionable insights for urban planners and policymakers to devise traffic management strategies. 

This study not only contributes to understanding the implications of climate change on urban traffic but also supports the development of adaptive measures to mitigate congestion, ensuring smoother traffic flow in Bangalore's growing metropolis.


### Conclusion
In this study, we used ARIMA modeling to forecast traffic rates in Bangalore over the next 10 months, predicting traffic patterns on a month-by-month basis. The model provided valuable insights into future traffic trends, which can help in urban planning and traffic management. Our analysis also revealed the significant impact of climate conditions on traffic volume, with adverse weather conditions, such as heavy rainfall, leading to increased congestion. Furthermore, the examination of traffic patterns by weekdays showed that Mondays and Fridays typically experienced the highest traffic volumes, likely due to the start and end of the workweek. Monthly traffic analysis highlighted specific months where traffic volumes peaked, potentially due to seasonal factors or local events. Additionally, we identified a clear relationship between weekdays and climate changes, with poor weather exacerbating congestion on already busy days, emphasizing the complex interaction between temporal patterns and environmental factors. This research highlights the importance of integrating both weather and temporal data for more accurate traffic predictions and better traffic management strategies in Bangalore.
